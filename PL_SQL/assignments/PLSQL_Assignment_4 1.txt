1. Create a PL/SQL program that declares a nested table of integers, populates it with values (e.g., 10, 20, 30), and then displays the elements of the nested table.

2. Create a PL/SQL program that declares a varray of characters with a fixed size of 5. 
Implement a loop to take input from the user for all five elements of the varray and then display the contents of the varray.

3. Create a PL/SQL program that declares an associative array (index-by table) of student names and their respective scores in a test. Populate the array with at least five records and then display the student names along with their scores.

4. Write a PL/SQL program that uses an associative array of question 3. Calculate the average of all the values of the scores in the array.

5. Create a PL/SQL program that declares a nested table of timestamps. 
Implement a loop to populate the collection with timestamps representing different dates and times, 
and then display the timestamps in chronological order.
